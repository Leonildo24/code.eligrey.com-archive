JavaScript Shell 1.4 Extended is a modified version of http://www.squarefree.com/shell/shell.html
- print() now supports multiple arguments
- console.log() is created if undefined
- _win.eval is used instead of changing _win.location.href to a javascript URI. This is to support different JS versions
- Loads json2.js if no native browser JSON support is present
- no javascript: URIs are used, so eval()'d strings are treated under the specified javascript version
- automatically runs code under the highest JavaScript version available
- a variable named JavaScript_version shows the highest JS version support in browser. undefined if browser doesn't support explicit JS versions
