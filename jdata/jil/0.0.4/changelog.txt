Changelog for JIL 0.0.4:

- JIL is now a function with properties, not just an object
- JIL method calls are now chainable
- No longer removes listeners if they are not already set
- Added JIL.requestCallbacks.reset([key])
- Replaced all single quotes with double quotes because I felt like it
- JIL.loadFrame([readyCallback]) now passes readyCallback the JIL function
- Added JIL.changeHost([origin [, path[, callback]]]) for easy host changing
- JIL.query now only adds a callback if it is a function
- JIL.handleMessage renamed to JIL.handleResponse
- Grouped the fields first then the methods in the initialization for orginization
- JIL.generateID removed and an anonymous ran-once function named safeRandID with collision prevention was placed inside JIL.query
- JIL.frame.contentWindow.postMessage's second argument is now always JIL.origin instead of "*"
